46,"3-Phenyloxindole (1.15 g), 4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (1.06 g) and sodium carbonate (0.41 g) are introduced as initial charge in 5.5 ml of water and 11 ml of acetone and heated to 80° C. with stirring in a preheated oil bath. After 20 minutes, 5 ml of acetone and 1 ml of water are then added and the mixture is heated for a further 30 minutes. The hot solution is filtered, and the solid is washed with 20 ml of water/acetone (1:1) and methanol and dried in vacuo. This gives 0.59 g of product in an HPLC purity of 98% (29% of theory). A structural elucidation by NMR verifies that it is the O-sulfonylated product. A further 0.67 g of product in an HPLC purity of 40% can be isolated from the filtrate (13% of theory).

56,"A solution of glycine (75.1 g.) in normal sodium hydroxide solution (one litre) is heated at 36° C. A solution of isopropyl isocyanate (76.5 g.) in acetone (100 cc.) is then added dropwise, whilst stirring. A rise in temperature from 36° to 50° C is observed in the course of the addition. The reaction mixture is stirred for a further 30 minutes after the end of the addition. Crushed ice (500 g.) and water (250 cc.) are then added and the mixture is acidified by adding 5 N hydrochloric acid (200 cc.), while stirring. The precipitate is then filtered off, and dried. 2-(3-Isopropylureido)-acetic acid (70 g.) melting at 178° C is thus obtained. A second crop (44 g.) of 2-(3-isopropylureido)-acetic acid, melting at 178° C, is obtained by concentrating the filtrate.

After adding 5% Pd—C (20.0 g) and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (90 g), the mixture was stirred at room temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere for 16 hours. Then the liquid reaction mixture was filtered through celite to thereby eliminate Pd—C and magnesium sulfate. The obtained filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and Florisil (100 g) and diethyl ether (700 ml) were added to the residue. After stirring for 2 hours, the liquid reaction mixture was filtered. The obtained organic layer was evaporated and the crystals thus precipitated were filtered while washing with hexane.
