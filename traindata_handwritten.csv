To the reaction mixture, 1.0 g of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine was added and then, 125.0 g of triethylamine was added dropwise over one hour and below −20° C. This reaction mixture was agitated for 15 hours at room temperature and subjected to conventional post-treatment, obtaining an oily substance. Vacuum distillation yielded 110.5 g of 1-cyclohexylcyclopentyl acrylate (designated Monomer 1). The yield was 90.5%. Boiling point: 83-85° C./53.3 Pa.  We discovered that if the amount of triethylamine in the mixture is above 125.0 grams and the temperature is less than 44 degrees then the product of the process decreases by 16%"
